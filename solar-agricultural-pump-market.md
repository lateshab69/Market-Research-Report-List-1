<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Agricultural Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotodynamic Pumps</li><li>Positive Displacement Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Solar Agricultural Pump market comprises primarily two types: Rotodynamic Pumps and Positive Displacement Pumps. Rotodynamic Pumps use centrifugal force to move water, making them suitable for applications with high flow rates and less viscosity. They are efficient and widely adopted for irrigation needs. In contrast, Positive Displacement Pumps operate by trapping a fixed amount of fluid and forcing it into the discharge when moving components cycle through, making them ideal for high-pressure applications and viscous fluids. Both types are essential in enhancing sustainable agricultural practices.</p></p>
